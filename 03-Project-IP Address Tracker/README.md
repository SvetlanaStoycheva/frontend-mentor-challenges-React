3. IP Address Tracker

- [see project](https://sweta-fm-ip-tracker.netlify.app)
- To get the IP Address locations, we'll be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify (https://geo.ipify.org). To generate the map, we are using LeafletJS (https://leafletjs.com).
- Users see their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load. They can search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.
